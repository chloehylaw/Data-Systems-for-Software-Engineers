j. Let us find the close friends of Annette Nicole. Print the names of all actors who have starred
in (at least) all movies in which Annette Nicole has starred in. Note that it is OK if these
actors have starred in more movies than Annette Nicole has played in. Since PostgreSQL
does not provide a relational division operator, we will guide you through the following steps
(you might find it useful to consult the slides or the textbook for the alternative "double
negation" method of performing relational division).

iv. Finally, from the view co_actors, eliminate the distinct actors that appear in the view
non_extistent. Print the names of all co_actors except Annette Nicole.
