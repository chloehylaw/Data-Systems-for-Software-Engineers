/*
h. Let us find out who are the ’no flop’ actors. A ’no flop’ actor can be defined as one who has
played only in movies which have a rating greater than or equal to 4. We split this problem
into the following steps.

i. Create a view called high ratings which contains the distinct names of all actors who
have played in movies with a rating greater than or equal to 4. Similarly, create a view
called low ratings which contains the distinct names of all actors who have played in
movies with a rating less than 4. Print the number of rows in each view.

CREATE VIEW high_ratings AS
SELECT DISTINCT actors.name, movies.rating
FROM actors, movies
WHERE movies.rating >= 4
AND movies.mid = actors.mid;

CREATE VIEW low_ratings AS
SELECT DISTINCT actors.name, movies.rating
FROM actors, movies
WHERE movies.rating < 4
AND movies.mid = actors.mid;

SELECT(
	SELECT COUNT(high_ratings.name) 
	FROM high_ratings) AS high_ratings_num_rows,
	(
		SELECT COUNT(low_ratings.name) 
		FROM low_ratings) AS low_ratings_num_rows;
