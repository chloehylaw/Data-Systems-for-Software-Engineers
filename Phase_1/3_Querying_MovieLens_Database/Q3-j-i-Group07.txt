j. Let us find the close friends of Annette Nicole. Print the names of all actors who have starred
in (at least) all movies in which Annette Nicole has starred in. Note that it is OK if these
actors have starred in more movies than Annette Nicole has played in. Since PostgreSQL
does not provide a relational division operator, we will guide you through the following steps
(you might find it useful to consult the slides or the textbook for the alternative "double
negation" method of performing relational division).

i. First, create a view called co_actors, which returns the distinct names of actors who
played in at least one movie with Annette Nicole. Print the number of rows in this
view.

CREATE VIEW co_actors AS

WHERE m.mid in (SELECT m.mid
                FROM movies m , actors a
                WHERE a.name = 'Annette Nicole'
                and a.mid = m.mid)
    and m.mid = a. mid;
SELECT count(*) from co_actors
