h. Let us find out who are the ’no flop’ actors. A ’no flop’ actor can be defined as one who has
played only in movies which have a rating greater than or equal to 4. We split this problem
into the following steps.

iii. For each ’no flop’ actor, print the name of the actor and the number of movies N that
he/she played in, sorted in descending order of N. Finally, print the top 10 only.
