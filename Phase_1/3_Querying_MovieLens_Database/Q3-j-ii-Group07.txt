/*
j. Let us find the close friends of Annette Nicole. Print the names of all actors who have starred
in (at least) all movies in which Annette Nicole has starred in. Note that it is OK if these
actors have starred in more movies than Annette Nicole has played in. Since PostgreSQL
does not provide a relational division operator, we will guide you through the following steps
(you might find it useful to consult the slides or the textbook for the alternative "double
negation" method of performing relational division).

ii. Second, create a view called all_combinations which returns all possible combinations
of co_actors and the movie ids in which Annette Nicole played. Print the number of
rows in this view. Note how that this view contains fake (co_actor, mid) combinations!

CREATE VIEW all_combinations AS
SELECT c.name, m.mid
FROM movies m, co_actors c
WHERE m.mid in (SELECT m.mid
                FROM movies m , actors a
                WHERE a.name = 'Annette Nicole'
                and a.mid = m.mid);
SELECT count(*) from all_combinations
