/*
(b) Profile the query execution time with and without the indexes.

 After creating the indexes we notice an improvement in the query execution time for example:

 - question 3-k-1 takes around 200ms before indexes and that improves to around 100ms after creating the indexes.
 - question 3-k-2 takes around 30 SECONDS to query all fields on the created view. After indexes the average is around 13 SECONDS.
 - question 3-i takes around 500ms to execute before indexes. After indexes that is reduced to around 300ms.
 - question 3-g takes around 160ms before indexing, after it improves to around 80ms.
 - other improvements can be seen on other queries as well with varying degrees.
