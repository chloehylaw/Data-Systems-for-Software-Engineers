/*
(b) Profile the query execution time with and without the indexes.

 After creating the indexes we notice an improvement in the query execution time for example:

 - question 3-k-1 takes around 200ms before indexes and that improves to around 100ms after creating the indexes.
 - question 3-k-2 takes around 30 SECONDS to query all fields on the created view. After indexes the average is around 13 SECONDS.
 - question 3-i takes around 500ms to execute before indexes. After indexes that is reduced to around 300ms.
 - question 3-g takes around 160ms before indexing, after it improves to around 80ms.
 - other improvements can be seen on other queries as well with varying degrees.

========================================================================================================================

For questions 3-k-2 and 3-l we asked you to use views. However, we are now interested in
exploring the performance between views and materialized views. for this reason:

(a) Re-implement your answer for question 3-k-2 using materialized views.

(b) Re-implement your answer for questions 3-l using materialized views.

-- a) Re-implement your answer for question 3-k-2 using materialized views.
/*
we notice that querying the materialized view takes around 90ms compared to the normal view which takes
around 13 SECONDS. This makes sense because we know that on a normal view we compute the result every time
we query the view, but on a materialized view the data is actually stored and we do not need to compute it 
on the fly which makes materialized view significantly faster. However, we have to rememebr that wer need
to refresh materialized views to update the data inside it.
